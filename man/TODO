mawk was implemented to conform with POSIX 1003.2-1992

According to

	http://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/posix_faq.html

that was merged into POSIX-1003.1, and the latest relevant text of that is
documented here:

	http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html

The extended regular expressions are documented here:

	http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html

Sections below refer to the awk.html sections.

OPTIONS
	mawk complies here.

OPERANDS
	mawk complies here.

STDIN
	mawk complies here.

INPUT FILES
	mawk complies here.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
	mawk ignores LC_COLLATE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_NUMERIC and NLSPATH

	mawk implements extensions

	MAWKBINMODE which gawk does as BINMODE

	MAWK_LONG_OPTIONS to ignore long options such as gawk's.  Values
	are: error, warn, ignore (only the first character is checked).

	WHINY_USERS feature from gawk which makes iteration over array
	in sorted order.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
	strings are converted to double using strtod(), which could be
	implemented using atof().

	ENVIRON and CONVFMT are in the standard now, not extensions.

>Expressions in awk
	mawk complies

>Variables and Special Variables
	mawk complies

>Regular Expressions
	mawk's built-in regular expressions do not support brace expressions
	(used to denote minimum/maximum number of matches).

	mawk can be built with an external regular-expression library.
	However, POSIX regular expressions do not support matches of
	NUL-bytes.  mawk's internal regular expressions support NULs.

>Expression Patterns
	ok

>Pattern Ranges
	ok

>Actions
	delete is now part of POSIX-1003.1

>Output Statements
	mawk does not use popen/pclose for opening/closing a pipe.

>Arithmetic Functions
	ok

>String Functions
	toupper and tolower are now part of POSIX-1003.1

>Input/Output and General Functions
	ok

>User-Defined Functions
	ok
