mawk was implemented to conform with POSIX 1003.2-1992

According to

	http://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/posix_faq.html

that was merged into POSIX-1003.1, and the latest relevant text of that is
documented here:

	http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/awk.html

The extended regular expressions are documented here:

	mawk can be built with an external regular-expression library.
	However, POSIX regular expressions do not support matches of
	NUL-bytes.

	ok

>Pattern Ranges
	ok

	delete is now part of POSIX-1003.1

>Output Statements
	mawk does not use pclose for closing a pipe.
