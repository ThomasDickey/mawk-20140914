Changes by Thomas E Dickey <dickey@invisible-island.net>

20091220
	+ bump version to 1.3.4

	+ update INSTALL and README files.

	+ improve configure checks for math library.

	  + change test for NaN to use sqrt() rather than log() to work around
	    cygwin's partly broken math functions.

	  + add/use isnanf() to work around other breakage in cygwin math
	    functions.

	  + add configure check for _XOPEN_SOURCE, etc., needed to define
	    proper function pointer for sigaction, e.g., on Tru64.

	  + add check for sigaction function pointer, whose POSIX form is
	    absent from the cygwin header.

	+ extend MAWKBINMODE, adding a third bit which when set will suppress
	  the change for RS or ORS to use CR/LF rather than LF.  This is used
	  for MinGW to make the "check" rule in a build work, for instance.

	+ add configure check for functions used for pipe/system calls, e.g.,
	  for MinGW where these are absent.

	+ add runtime check for floating-point underflow exceptions

	+ fix an old 1.3.3 bug in re_split(), which did not check properly for
	  the end of buffer; this broke on Tru64.

	+ drop obsolete config-user, v7 and atarist subdirectories

	+ improve configure checks for sigaction, making the definitions used
	  in fpe_check.c consistent with matherr.c

	+ build fixes for AIX, Tru64.

	+ add configure check for 'environ'.

	+ remove redundant setlocale() calls; only LC_CTYPE and LC_NUMERIC
	  are used.

20091213
	+ add makedeps.sh script to aid in updating object dependencies in
	  Makefile.in

	+ use "mkdir -p" rather than mkdirs.sh (suggested by Aleksey Cheusov).

	+ reformatted this file, to simplify extraction of contributor names.

	+ update config.guess and config.sub

	> patches by Jonathan Nieder:

	+ modify CF_DISABLE_ECHO autoconf macro to ensure that command lines
	  in Makefile.in begin with a tab.

	+ the makefile does not use $(MAKE); remove the SET_MAKE substitution.

	+ add some files to the "make clean" rule, in case make gets
	  interrupted in the middle of a rule.

	+ add a maintainer-clean rule to the makefile, to remove files which
	  could be regenerated.

	+ fix an unescaped "-" in man/mawk.1

	+ remove an unneeded cast in bi_funct.c

	+ fix an unused parameter warning in matherr.c

	+ drop unused line_no parameter from compile_error() and its callers.

	+ convert makescan.c to ANSI C, do further cleanup of that file.

	+ split-out scancode.h from scan.h

20090920
	+ improve hash function by using FNV-1 algorithm (patch/analysis by
	  Jim Mellander).  This greatly improves speed for accessing arrays
	  with a large number of distinct keys; however the unsorted order in
	  "for" loops will differ.

	+ add "internal regex" or "external regex" string to version message to
	  allow scripting based on support for embedded nulls.

	+ drop obsolete CF_MAWK_PROG_GCC and CF_MAWK_PROG_YACC macros from
	  configure script (report by Mike Frysinger).

	+ fixes to allow build outside source-tree (report by Mike Frysinger).

	+ correct logic in scan.c to handle expression "[[]" (report by Aleksey
	  Cheusov).

	+ add MAWK_LONG_OPTIONS feature to allow mawk to ignore long options
	  which are not implemented.

	+ two changes for embedded nulls, allows FS to be either a null or
	  contain a character class with null, e.g., '\000' or '[ \000]':

	  + modify built-in regular expression functions to accept embedded
	    nulls.

	  + modify input reader FINgets() to accept embedded nulls in data read
	    from files.  Data read from standard input is line-buffered, and is
	    still null-terminated.

	+ update config.guess and config.sub

20090820
	+ minor portability/standards fixes for examples/hical

	+ add WHINY_USERS sorted-array feature, for compatibility with gawk
	  (patch by Aharon Robbins).

	+ correct lower-limit for d_to_U() function, which broke conversion of
	  zero in "%x" format, added in fix for Debian #303825 (report by
	  Masami Hiramatsu).

	+ modify "%s" and "%c" formatting in printf/sprintf commands to ensure
	  that "%02s" does not do zero-padding, for standards conformance
	  (discussion with Aharon Robbins, Mike Brennan, prompted by Debian
	  #339799).

20090728
	+ add fallback definitions for GCC_NORETURN and GCC_UNUSED to build
	  with non-gcc compilers (report by Jan Wells).

20090727
	+ add check/fix to prevent gsub from recurring to modify on a substring
	  of the current line when the regular expression is anchored to the
	  beginning of the line; fixes gawk's anchgsub testcase.

	+ add check for implicit concatenation mistaken for exponent; fixes
	  gawk's hex testcase.

	+ add character-classes to built-in regular expressions.

	+ add 8-bit locale support

20090726
	+ improve configure checks for MAX__UINT.

	+ add a check for infinite loop in REmatch(), to work with gawk's
	  noloop1 testcase.

	+ modify logic to allow setting RS to an explicit null character, e.g.,
		RS="\0"
	  (Ubuntu #400409).

	+ modify workaround for (incorrect) scripts which use a zero-parameter
	  for substr to ensure the overall length of the result stays the same.
	  For example, from makewhatis:
		filename_no_gz = substr(filename, 0, RSTART - 1);

	+ move regular-expression files into main directory to simplify
	  building using configure --srcdir and VPATH.

	+ modify internal functions for gsub() to handle a case from makewhatis
	  script from man 1.6f which substitutes embedded zero bytes to a
	  different value (report by Gabor Z Papp).

	+ change default for configure --with-builtin-regex to prefer the
	  builtin regular expressions.  They are incomplete, but POSIX regular
	  expressions cannot match nulls embedded in strings.

	+ require standard C compiler; converted to ANSI C.

	+ rename #define'd SV_SIGINFO to MAWK_SV_SIGINFO to avoid predefined
	  name on Mac OS X (report on comp.lang.awk).

	+ revise configure script to use conventional scheme for generating
	  config.h

20090721
	+ port to cygwin, modifying test-script to work with executable-suffix
	  and fp-exception code to allow const in declaration.

20090712
	+ bump patch-date.

	+ fix Debian #127293 "mawk does not understand unescaped '/' in
	  character classes", noting that gawk 3.1.6 also has problems with
	  this area.

	+ drop support for varargs; use stdarg only.

	+ add tags rule to makefile.

	+ rename configure option "--with-local-regexp" to
	  "--with-builtin-regex"

	+ add build-fix from NetBSD port:  enable vax FP support when
	  defined(__vax__) as well as BSD43_VAX.  from ragge.

	+ add configure --disable-echo option

	+ identify updated files with "MawkId" keywords, retaining old log
	  comments for reference.  Ongoing changes are recorded here.

	+ change maintainer email address to my own.

20090711
	+ use conventional install/uninstall rules in makefile.

	+ add install-sh script, mkdirs.sh, config.guess and config.sub

	+ add $DESTDIR support to makefile

	+ add uninstall make-target

	+ add configure --enable-warnings option (fixed some warnings...)

	+ change configure script to autoconf 2.52 to permit cross-compiles.

	+ drop config.user file; replace with conventional autoconf --prefix,
	  etc.

	+ fill-in CA_REC.type in two places in parse.y which weren't
	  initialized.

	+ fix Debian #38353 (absent expression on last part of "for" statement
	  caused core-dump).

	+ fix Debian #303825 (printf %x clamps numbers to signed range rather
	  than unsigned range).

	+ apply fix from Debian #355966 (null-pointer check in
	  is_string_split())

	+ apply fix from Debian #391051 (limit-check in scan.c)

20090709
	+ add support for external regexp libraries (patch by Aleksey Cheusov)
	  (originally comp.lang.awk June 15 2005, also cited in Debian #355442
	  March 6, 2006).

20090705
	+ fixes to build on BeOS (if LIBS is set to -lroot), and QNX
	  (redefinition of setmode).

20080909
	+ fix gcc 4.3.1 -Wall warnings

	+ transform mawk.ac.m4 to aclocal.m4, renaming macros to use "CF_" or
	  "CF_MAWK_" prefixes depending on their reusability.  Modified macros
	  to use quoting consistent with recent autoconf versions.

	+ regenerate configure with autoconf version 2.13.20030927

	+ regenerate parse.c with byacc - 1.9 20080827

	+ ifdef'd prototypes in nstd.h which belong to stdlib.h, string.h to
	  use standard C by default.

	+ source-in Debian patches 01-08 (see below).  Changes for 20080909 fix
	  Debian #496980 as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 Sep 1996

1) Numeric but not integer indices caused core dump in new array scheme.
   Fixed bug and fired test division.

2) Added ferror() checks on writes.

3) Added some static storage specs to array.c to keep non-ansi
   compilers happy.

1.3 -> 1.3.1 Sep 1996
Release to new ftp site ftp://ftp.whidbey.net.

1) Workaround for overflow exception in strtod, sunos5.5 solaris.

2) []...] and [^]...] put ] in a class (or not in a class) without
   having to use back-slash escape.

1.2.2 -> 1.3 Jul 1996
Extensive redesign of array data structures to support large arrays and
fast access to arrays created with split.  Many of the ideas in the
new design were inspired by reading "The Design and Implementation of
Dynamic Hashing Sets and Tables in Icon" by William Griswold and
Gregg Townsend, SPE 23,351-367.

1.2.1 -> 1.2.2  Jan 1996

1) Improved autoconfig, in particular, fpe tests.  This is far from
   perfect and never will be until C standardizes an interface to ieee754.

2) Removed automatic error message on open failure for getline.

3) Flush all output before system().  Previous behavior was to only
   flush std{out,err}.

4) Explicitly fclose() all output on exit to work around AIX4.1 bug.

5) Fixed random number generator to work with longs larger than
   32bits.

6) Added a type Int which is int on real machines and long on dos machines.
   Believe that all implicit assumptions that int=32bits are now gone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from version 1.1.4 to 1.2:

1) Limit on code size set by #define in sizes.h is gone.

2) A number of obscure bugs have been fixed such as,
   you can now make a recursive function call inside a for( i in A) loop.
   Function calls with array parameters in loop expressions sometimes
   generated erroneous internal code.

   See RCS log comments in code for details.

   Reported bugs are fixed.

3) new -W options


   -We file   :  reads commands from file and next argument, regardless
	      of form, is ARGV[1].  Useful  for passing -v , -f etc to
	      an awk program started with #!/.../mawk


      #!/usr/local/bin/mawk -We

      myprogram -v   works, while

      #!/usr/local/bin/mawk -f

      myprogram -v    gives error message
	  mawk: option -v lacks argument

      This is really a posix bozo.  Posix says you end arguments with
      "--" , but this doesn't work with the "#!" convention.

   -W interactive :  forces stdout to be unbuffered and stdin to
	be line buffered.  Records from stdin are lines regardless of
	the value of RS.  Useful for interaction with a mawk on a pipe.

   -W dump, -Wd   :  disassembles internal code to stdout (used to be
       stderr) and exits 0.

4)  FS = "" causes each record to be broken into characters and placed
     into $1,$2 ...

     same with split(x,A,"") and split(x,A,//)

5)  print > "/dev/stdout"  writes to stdout, exactly the same as
    print

    This is useful for passing stdout to

    function my_special_output_routine(s, file)
    {
	# do something fancy with s
	print s > file
    }

6) New built-in function fflush() -- copied from the lastest att awk.

      fflush() : flushes stdout  and returns 0
      fflush(file)  flushes file and returns 0; if file was not an
      open output file then returns -1.

7)  delete  A ;  -- removes all elements of the array A

    intended to replace:

	 for( i in A) delete A[i]

8)  mawk errors such as compilation failure, file open failure, etc.
    now exit 2 which reserves exit 1 for the user.

9)  No program now silently exits 0, prior behavior was to exit 2 with
    an error message
