Changes by Thomas E Dickey <dickey@invisible-island.net>

2009071?
	add configure --disable-echo option

	identify updated files with "MawkId" keywords, retaining old log
	comments for reference.  Ongoing changes are recorded here.

	update maintainer email address.

20090711
	use conventional install/uninstall rules in makefile.

	add install-sh script, mkdirs.sh, config.guess and config.sub

	add $DESTDIR support to makefile

	add uninstall make-target

	add configure --enable-warnings option (fixed some warnings...)

	update configure script to autoconf 2.52 to permit cross-compiles.

	drop config.user file; replace with conventional autoconf --prefix, etc.

	fill-in CA_REC.type in two places in parse.y which weren't initialized.

	fix Debian #38353 (absent expression on last part of "for" statement
	caused core-dump).

	fix Debian #303825 (printf %x clamps numbers to signed range rather
	than unsigned range).

	apply fix from Debian #355966 (null-pointer check in is_string_split())

	apply fix from Debian #391051 (limit-check in scan.c)

20090709
	add patch from Aleksey Cheusov for external regexp libraries
	(originally comp.lang.awk June 15 2005, also cited in Debian #355442
	March 6, 2006).

20090705
	fixes to build on BeOS (if LIBS is set to -lroot), and QNX (redefinition
	of setmode).

20080909
	fix gcc 4.3.1 -Wall warnings

	transform mawk.ac.m4 to aclocal.m4, renaming macros to use "CF_" or
	"CF_MAWK_" prefixes depending on their reusability.  Modified macros
	to use quoting consistent with recent autoconf versions.

	regenerate configure with autoconf version 2.13.20030927

	regenerate parse.c with byacc - 1.9 20080827

	ifdef'd prototypes in nstd.h which belong to stdlib.h, string.h to
	use standard C by default.

	source-in Debian patches 01-08 (see below).  Changes for 20080909 fix
	Debian #496980 as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 Sep 1996

1) Numeric but not integer indices caused core dump in new array scheme.
   Fixed bug and fired test division.

2) Added ferror() checks on writes.

3) Added some static storage specs to array.c to keep non-ansi 
   compilers happy.

1.3 -> 1.3.1 Sep 1996
Release to new ftp site ftp://ftp.whidbey.net.

1) Workaround for overflow exception in strtod, sunos5.5 solaris.

2) []...] and [^]...] put ] in a class (or not in a class) without
   having to use back-slash escape.

1.2.2 -> 1.3 Jul 1996
Extensive redesign of array data structures to support large arrays and
fast access to arrays created with split.  Many of the ideas in the
new design were inspired by reading "The Design and Implementation of
Dynamic Hashing Sets and Tables in Icon" by William Griswold and
Gregg Townsend, SPE 23,351-367.
 
1.2.1 -> 1.2.2  Jan 1996

1) Improved autoconfig, in particular, fpe tests.  This is far from
   perfect and never will be until C standardizes an interface to ieee754.

2) Removed automatic error message on open failure for getline.

3) Flush all output before system().  Previous behavior was to only
   flush std{out,err}.

4) Explicitly fclose() all output on exit to work around AIX4.1 bug. 

5) Fixed random number generator to work with longs larger than
   32bits.

6) Added a type Int which is int on real machines and long on dos machines.
   Believe that all implicit assumptions that int=32bits are now gone.
