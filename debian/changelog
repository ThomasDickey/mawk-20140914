mawk (1.3.3-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer; closes: #496711.
  * Drop versioned gcc build-dependency, which has been satisfied since
    before oldstable.
  * debian/rules: fix up clean target to use a simpler, standard distclean
    call, fixing a lintian warning.
  * debian/rules: future-proof the clean target for patch interaction
    with the build system, moving all the cleaning into a
    "clean-patched" target that fires before the unpatch target

    04_mawk.1-fix-pi and 05_-Wall-fixes.
  * debian/rules: include /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch.make.
  * debian/rules (build): depend on patch-stamp.

    variables.

  * debian/rules (clean): remove parse.c and parse.h so they're not
    included in the .diff.gz.

  * 07_mawktest-check-devfull: new patch to conditionalize the write error
    tests on the existence of /dev/full since apparently some systems
    don't have it.  Requested by Marcus.Brinkmann@ruhr-uni-bochum.de.
    Closes: #51875

  * debian/postinst: demote mawk to priority 5 so that gawk will be
    selected by default.  [mawk isn't being actively maintained upstream
    and has both long-standing bugs and isn't feature-complete WRT POSIX
    at least.]
